# S&P 500 Volatility

This repository contains an exploratory R script related to past volatility in the S&P 500 as a predictor of future.

This is the hypothesis to test: the economic reaction to "news events" is incorporated into the price of the S&P 500 as observable sine waves in price, ("volatility,") decaying exponentially, as investors "buy low" and "sell high" in direct and indirect reaction to the news. An economically significant "news event" has a time of origin at which it "turns on," (representable by a Heaviside theta,) from which it oscillates into the future price of the index as a damped sine wave with node at the "turn on" point. News is either "good," (positive amplitude,) or "bad," (negative amplitude,) but either type of news results in relative oscillations of price between both higher and lower over time, as the ramifications of the news are priced into the index. These oscillations with origin times each have "frequencies," implying rates of time at which investors react to the news, but we do not hypothesize any model predicting the period on which investors react to any arbitrary economic news. So far, this work is exploratory, without quantitative validation.

Spectral analysis has been carried out on the S&P 500 price **differentials** at close-of-week since January 1st, 1928. Heaviside theta "turn-on" points have been omitted from the analysis so far, for model simplicity. So that we may linearly regress future price impacts, we incorporate the **exponential decay** of wave components into the regression model by way of an **exponential growth** transform on the S&P 500 index price, such that waves in volatility **never** decay in the transformed data, allowing for linear regression.

There might be a dependence of wave decay rate on wave frequency, either at least arbitrarily parameterized or akin to physical waves in a refractory medium. If the average APR of the S&P 500 price is (hypothetically, to basic general knowledge) a consistent 6% to 8%, then the lowest decay rate waves sustainable must have 6% to 8% decay rate. Lower decay rates would "inflate" exponentially faster than the average growth of the market, giving them imaginary number frequency and therefore only contributing to exponential growth or decay of price, therefore not exhibiting finite wave period. Waves at this threshold are likely the lowest frequencies (and highest periods) exhibited in price fluctuations. To begin a systemic analysis, we will look to identify and fit these waves at the coarsest graining of moving average market price, first. We will then proceed by (perhaps by harmonics) to higher frequencies and rates of wave decay.

We hope this R script and spreadsheet will spur research and help give the market peace-of-mind!
